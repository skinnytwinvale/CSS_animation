## Transforms
Transforms are a newer CSS technology that allow us to move elements on the page by translating them, rotating them, scaling them, and more. Sometimes these transforms are used in isolation, but they're more commonly found in conjunction with CSS animations

- transform: CSS transforms change the shape and position of the affected content and allow you
to translate, rotate, scale, and skew elements.

A transformation is an effect that lets an element change shape, size and position. Here are a few of the methods that can be values of transform property:

- translate - The translate() method moves an element from its current position. For example, if you give an element the rule transform: translate(50px,100px);, the element will be 50 pixels to the right and 100 pixels down.

- rotate - The rotate() method rotates an element clockwise or counter-clockwise according to a given degree. For example, if you give an element the rule transform: rotate(90deg);, the element will rotate 90Â° clockwise.

- scale - The scale() method increases or decreases the size of an element (according to the parameters given for the width and height). For example, if you give an element the rule transform: scale(2,3);, the element will scaled 200% horizontally and 300% vertically.
